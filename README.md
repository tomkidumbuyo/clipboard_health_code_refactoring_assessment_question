## Refactoring

This challenge is in JavaScript. Even if it's not your primary language, you should still give it a shot!

You've been asked to refactor the attached function to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

- Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
- Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
- Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.
